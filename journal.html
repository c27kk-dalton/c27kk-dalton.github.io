Journal Entry 1, October 30th: My website is online but sadly this page is NOT burlywood, I may make that change in the future. The basektball tryouts started on Monday and they have been good but WAY too much running. My shot has been a little off which has been annoying me but it'll be fine in a little bit. School has been good and I got a decent history grade considering the fact that I put slop on the page. It is super rainy outside and it is a depressing day, but I ate a bacon egg and cheese with chiptole mayo so it made things better.
